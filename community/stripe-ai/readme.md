# Overview

brew install nvm
nvm use 20
```

# Install Restack Web UI

To install the Restack Web UI, you can use Docker.

```bash
docker run -d --pull always --name restack -p 5233:5233 -p 6233:6233 -p 7233:7233 -p 9233:9233 ghcr.io/restackio/restack:main
```

# Start services

Where all your code is defined, including workflow steps.

add OPENAI_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in .env

```bash
npm i
npm run build
